Welcome to my portfolio!

This website was intentionally developed using the basic web development technologies of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
I invite you to browse through, explore the different projects I have worked on, see the tools that I have used, and learn a little bit about me.

Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
